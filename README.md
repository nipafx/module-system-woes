# Module System Woes

In a quest to make the module system more approachable, I gathered common problems developers have with it (on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nipafx/status/1405765007200030720) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/o2jeiv/your_problems_with_java_modules/)) and plan to address them here.
This is still in very early stages...
